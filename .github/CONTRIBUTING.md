# Contributing guidelines

## Pull Requests

* User-visible changes **must** be documented in README.
* New/modified code **should** be covered by tests.
* **Must** pass linter and existing tests (CI will report failure).
  * It's recommended to use same [linter version](.circleci/config.yml#L8) as used by CI.
* Review by code owner is **required** before merge (controlled by GitHub).
